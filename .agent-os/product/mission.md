## The Problem

### Task Management Tool Complexity Crisis
Modern professionals spend 21% of their day managing the tools meant to make them productive, with the average worker using 9.4 different apps daily just to get work done. Existing task management solutions either lack essential features (simple todo apps) or overwhelm users with enterprise complexity (project management suites), leaving a gap for focused, capable tools.

**Our Solution:** Cascade delivers enterprise-level task organization capabilities through an intentionally minimal interface, combining multi-board flexibility with instant search and secure local storage to eliminate tool-switching overhead while maintaining professional-grade functionality.

## Differentiators

### Privacy-First Local Storage
Unlike cloud-based solutions like Asana or Notion, Cascade stores all data locally using IndexedDB, ensuring complete privacy and eliminating subscription costs. This results in zero data breaches, instant offline access, and compliance with strict confidentiality requirements.

### Lightweight Yet Powerful
Unlike simple todo apps that lack organization or complex project tools that require training, Cascade provides sophisticated multi-board task management in a sub-400KB application. This results in instant loading, minimal resource usage, and immediate productivity without learning curves.

### Cross-Board Intelligence
Unlike board-focused tools that silo tasks, Cascade provides unified search and task movement across unlimited project boards. This results in better project visibility and eliminates the mental overhead of remembering which board contains specific tasks.

### Zero Configuration Productivity
Unlike tools requiring setup wizards and admin configuration, Cascade works immediately with keyboard shortcuts, intuitive drag-and-drop, and automatic state management. This results in teams being productive within minutes rather than weeks.
