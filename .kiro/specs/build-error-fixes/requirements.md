# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses build errors and code quality issues that are preventing the application from compiling successfully. The errors include TypeScript/ESLint violations, React hooks dependency warnings, accessibility issues, and unused variable warnings across multiple files. The goal is to systematically fix these issues while maintaining code functionality and improving overall code quality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to build successfully without TypeScript or ESLint errors, so that I can deploy and distribute the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `npm run build` THEN the system SHALL complete the build process without any TypeScript compilation errors
2. WHEN I run `npm run build` THEN the system SHALL complete the build process without any ESLint errors that block the build
3. WHEN the build completes THEN all TypeScript `any` types SHALL be replaced with proper type definitions
4. WHEN the build completes THEN all unused variables and imports SHALL be removed or properly utilized

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want React components to follow best practices for hooks and dependencies, so that the application behaves predictably and avoids potential bugs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN React components use useEffect hooks THEN all dependencies SHALL be properly declared in the dependency array
2. WHEN React components have missing dependencies THEN the system SHALL either include the dependencies or use appropriate ESLint disable comments with justification
3. WHEN React components use hooks THEN they SHALL follow React hooks rules and best practices
4. WHEN components are refactored THEN existing functionality SHALL remain unchanged

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to follow consistent variable declaration patterns, so that the code is maintainable and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN variables are never reassigned THEN they SHALL be declared with `const` instead of `let`
2. WHEN variables are reassigned THEN they SHALL be declared with `let`
3. WHEN fixing variable declarations THEN the functionality SHALL remain unchanged
4. WHEN reviewing variable usage THEN unused variables SHALL be removed or properly utilized

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to be accessible and follow ARIA best practices, so that users with disabilities can effectively use the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ARIA attributes are used THEN they SHALL be compatible with the assigned roles
2. WHEN accessibility warnings are present THEN they SHALL be fixed using proper ARIA attributes and semantic HTML
3. WHEN fixing accessibility issues THEN the visual appearance and functionality SHALL remain unchanged
4. WHEN components use roles THEN they SHALL only include supported ARIA attributes for those roles

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test files to be clean and properly typed, so that tests are maintainable and provide reliable feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test files contain `any` types THEN they SHALL be replaced with proper type definitions or appropriate test utilities
2. WHEN test files have unused imports or variables THEN they SHALL be removed
3. WHEN fixing test files THEN all existing test functionality SHALL be preserved
4. WHEN updating test types THEN test coverage and assertions SHALL remain effective

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want import statements to be clean and only include necessary dependencies, so that the bundle size is optimized and code is maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN imports are unused THEN they SHALL be removed from the import statements
2. WHEN imports are used THEN they SHALL remain in the import statements
3. WHEN cleaning imports THEN the functionality SHALL remain unchanged
4. WHEN removing unused imports THEN the build size SHALL be optimized
