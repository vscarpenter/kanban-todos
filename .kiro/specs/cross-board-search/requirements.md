# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing search functionality to work across all boards rather than being limited to the current board. Users will be able to search for tasks across their entire workspace and easily navigate to tasks on different boards. The enhancement includes visual indicators showing which board each task belongs to and the ability to jump directly to a task on its respective board.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search for tasks across all my boards, so that I can find any task regardless of which board it's currently on.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enter a search term in the search bar THEN the system SHALL search across all boards, not just the current board
2. WHEN I perform a cross-board search THEN the system SHALL display results from all boards that match the search criteria
3. WHEN I clear the search THEN the system SHALL return to showing only tasks from the current board
4. WHEN I have an active search query THEN the system SHALL continue to show cross-board results even if I switch boards

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see which board each search result belongs to, so that I can understand the context of each task.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing cross-board search results THEN each task SHALL display a visual indicator showing which board it belongs to
2. WHEN viewing cross-board search results THEN the board indicator SHALL include the board name and color
3. WHEN viewing cross-board search results THEN the board indicator SHALL be clearly distinguishable from other task metadata
4. WHEN viewing search results from the current board THEN the board indicator SHALL be visually distinct from results from other boards

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate directly to a task on its board, so that I can view and edit the task in its proper context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click on a task from cross-board search results THEN the system SHALL navigate to the task's board
2. WHEN I navigate to a task's board from search results THEN the system SHALL highlight or focus the specific task
3. WHEN I navigate to a task's board THEN the system SHALL clear the search to show the full board context
4. WHEN I navigate to a task's board THEN the system SHALL maintain the task's selected state for easy identification

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to toggle between current-board-only and cross-board search modes, so that I can control the scope of my search based on my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the search functionality THEN the system SHALL provide a toggle option for search scope
2. WHEN I enable cross-board search THEN the system SHALL remember this preference for future searches
3. WHEN I disable cross-board search THEN the system SHALL revert to searching only the current board
4. WHEN I have cross-board search enabled THEN the search interface SHALL clearly indicate the current search scope

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want cross-board search to work with all existing filters, so that I can perform complex searches across my entire workspace.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I apply status filters during cross-board search THEN the system SHALL filter results across all boards
2. WHEN I apply priority filters during cross-board search THEN the system SHALL filter results across all boards  
3. WHEN I apply tag filters during cross-board search THEN the system SHALL filter results across all boards
4. WHEN I combine multiple filters with cross-board search THEN the system SHALL apply all filters to results from all boards

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the cross-board search to maintain good performance, so that searching remains fast even with many boards and tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I perform a cross-board search THEN the system SHALL return results within 500ms for up to 1000 tasks
2. WHEN I have multiple boards with many tasks THEN cross-board search SHALL not significantly impact application performance
3. WHEN I type in the search field THEN the system SHALL debounce search requests to avoid excessive processing
4. WHEN displaying cross-board results THEN the system SHALL efficiently render task cards with board indicators
