## Executive Summary

Cascade is a Lightweight Kanban boards type task management system build to be simple and secure.  It leverages IndexedDB
for local storage in the browser.  It supports the ability to have multiple board for group of tasks such as 'Work Tasks', 'Private Tasks', 'Health & Fitness', etc.  The tasks columns are 'To Do', 'In Progress' and 'Done' and the app support drag and drop functionality to move from one swimlane to another.

The app features a two-panel layout with the left side for the list of task boards such as 'Work Tasks', 'Private Tasks', 'Health & Fitness', etc. along with options for settings and other app configuration items. The right side of the layout
would have the Kanban board for task management.

The app would have the ability to search for tasks and so the search bar would be on the top
