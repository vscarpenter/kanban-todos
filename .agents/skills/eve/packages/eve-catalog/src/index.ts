/**
 * Shared identity for Eve integrations. This package is the single source of
 * truth for *which* integrations exist (channels and connections) and how a
 * connection is wired (transport + model-facing description).
 *
 * Surface-specific concerns live with their consumer, keyed by {@link
 * IntegrationEntry.slug}: the scaffolder (eve) overlays the
 * Connect auth spec it emits, and the docs gallery overlays presentation
 * (logo, keywords, auth modes, hand-authored markdown). Neither re-declares the
 * identity below.
 *
 * Everything lives in this one module on purpose. The catalog is consumed
 * directly from source by both NodeNext tooling (`tsgo` in eve,
 * which requires explicit `.js` import extensions) and Turbopack (the docs app,
 * which cannot resolve `.js` specifiers back to `.ts`). A single file with no
 * relative imports is the only shape that satisfies both without per-consumer
 * resolver configuration.
