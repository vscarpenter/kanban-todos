/**
 * Options accepted by `vercel(opts)`. Forwarded to Vercel
 * Sandbox creation for every fresh sandbox the framework creates
 * (template at prewarm time, session at first-time session-create).
 * Skipped on resume (`Sandbox.get`) since no create happens there.
 *
 * `networkPolicy` is deferred until after framework-owned base setup
 * for fresh templates and template-less sessions, so Eve can install
 * required packages before authored bootstrap code runs. Template-backed
 * session creates receive it at creation time because the template
 * already contains the prepared base runtime.
 *
 * Framework-injected fields (`name`, `onResume`, `persistent`, `signal`)
 * are excluded: the framework owns those and overrides any
 * author-supplied values.
 *
 * `source` is honored only on the template create at prewarm time, so
 * an author-supplied snapshot, git revision, or tarball becomes the
 * base layer for the template. Framework setup, bootstrap, and seed
 * files all run on top, and the resulting
 * framework-owned snapshot is what every later session derives from,
 * so `source` is stripped from the session-create path. Eve does not
 * detect external snapshot changes; to pick up a rebuilt external
 * snapshot, force a template rebuild (e.g. by changing the sandbox
 * definition so its template key changes).
