 *    caching the freshly minted token (the loop-guard flag).
 * 2. Runs the authored `execute` with a {@link ToolContext} whose
 *    `getToken()` / `requireAuth()` are bound to this tool's scope.
 * 3. On a thrown `ConnectionAuthorizationRequiredError` — implicit from
 *    `getToken()` or explicit via `requireAuth()` — either fails
 *    terminally (token rejected immediately after sign-in) or evicts the
 *    rejected token from the per-step cache and starts the interactive
 *    flow, returning an `AuthorizationSignal` to park the turn. An
 *    interactive strategy never rethrows the raw `Required` into the
 *    model: if no callback URL can be minted it fails with a classified
 *    {@link ConnectionAuthorizationFailedError} instead. Only
 *    non-interactive strategies rethrow the original error, since they
 *    have no consent flow to park on.
